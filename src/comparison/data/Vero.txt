2) Information We CollectPersonal Informationâ€œPersonal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, an Internet protocol (IP) address, and a photograph are examples of â€œPersonal Information.â€ We collect the following categories and types of Personal Information when you interact with us:Contact Information you provide: your first and last name, phone number, email address, shipping address and billing address. We only collect your shipping and billing information if you choose to use our â€œBuy Nowâ€ feature or â€œDonate Nowâ€ feature; however, this information is passed to our payment processor, Stripe (who then shares it with the vendor or charitable organization you are buying from or donating to). We do not access or store your credit card information or shipping information. Stripeâ€™s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy. To view Stripeâ€™s privacy policy, please click here; Other Identifiers: such as IP address and third-party social media handles (if you opt in to cross-posting to other social media services, post it on your VERO App account, or if you provide this information in support of your request to verify your VERO App account); Identity Verification Information: If you choose to verify your VERO app account, we rely on an independent third-party identity verification provider, Yoti, that requires our users to provide their identity verification information on the providerâ€™s own site or service. If you choose to verify your identity with our third-party identity verification provider, the providerâ€™s processing of personal information, including biometric information, will be subject to the providerâ€™s own terms and privacy policy (which will be presented to the customer during the verification process). To view Yotiâ€™s privacy policy, please click here.As part of the identity verification process, you may be asked to submit your name, phone number, email address, date of birth, government identification number and copies of government identification documents, along with a selfie image and/or video. The provider may use a combination of machine learning tools and optical scans to authenticate your identity document and conduct a â€œlivenessâ€ check, and may use facial recognition technology to produce a unique biometric identifier based on facial geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document you provided to determine the likelihood that the images are a "match." In this circumstance, the provider may retain a copy of your selfie image, video, and/or government ID (as well as the biometric facial geometry extracted from the images) for the purposes and length of time described in that providerâ€™s privacy policy, including for the purpose of streamlining future identity verification attempts using that providerâ€™s identity verification platform. Please review the providerâ€™s privacy policy closely to understand how your personal information, including biometric information, will be used, disclosed and retained by the identity verification provider.VERO does not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images, however, for identity verification and security purposes, VERO will receive the results of the identity verification process, including the images of your ID and the results of the liveness check, as well as text extracted from the ID scan. We may use some or all of this information and associated information to verify your account.Payment Information: credit card and debit card numbers (if you choose to use our â€œBuy Nowâ€ feature or â€œDonate Nowâ€ feature; however, please note that we use a third party payment processor, Stripe, to process this information.

3) When We Share Information with Third Parties Our Service Providers From time to time, we may engage other businesses whom we believe trustworthy and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours (â€œService Providersâ€). For example, we may engage Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, payment processing, data enhancement services, fraud prevention, and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by us.Our AffiliatesWe may share Personal Information and Usage Data (again, anonymized) with businesses controlling, controlled by, or under common control with VERO. If VERO is merged, acquired, or sold, or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, it will result in the handling of your Personal Information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.Law Enforcement and Courts We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties (for example, in connection with providing information relevant to a pending lawsuit or investigation) to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property, or rights of our company or of any third-party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.Ad Networks and Advertising Partners We work with third-party ad networks and advertising partners to deliver advertising and personalized content promoting the VERO app on other websites and services. These parties may collect information directly from a browser or device when an individual visits our Website through cookies or other data collection technologies. This information is used to provide and inform targeted advertising, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. For more information, please see the â€œThird-Party Data Collection and Online Advertisingâ€ section.




Cookies and Anonymous IdentifiersWe may use cookies and similar technologies to store anonymous identifiers (a random string of characters) and other user information on your device to remember your settings and temporarily (until the data is removed from your device or the cookie runs out) identify you. We may also use this to collect Usage Data to analyze use of and improve the VERO Website, the VERO App, and our other Services. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, certain features of the Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies. Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies, anonymous identifiers, or other tracking technology only in connection with the services they perform on our behalf to keep the Services functioning.4) Personal Information You Make Available to OthersBy using the VERO Website or the Services you may make certain of your Personal Information available to others. For example, when you post a comment or a photo on the VERO App other users may see your name, content, and other information that you choose to make available to them. Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the VERO App becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings. You can change your privacy settings directly in the VERO App at any time by going to your profile setting. Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any user content that you make public is searchable by other users, including on the VERO Website. If you remove information that you posted to the VERO App, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the VERO App, or if other users have copied or saved that information.In addition, we may share certain information about you, such as IP address, with your consent or direction. For example, if you search for an image using Bing, your search terms and IP address may be shared with Microsoft Corporation. In some instances, such as with your use of Bing, these third partiesâ€™ privacy practices are governed by their respective privacy policies. Bingâ€™s privacy policy is available at https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.5) Inviting a contact to use VERO from the â€œAdd Contactsâ€ feature; Sharing your Contact Information; Finding contacts on VEROWe provide three features in the VERO App for you to expand your network on VERO: â€œInvite Friends,â€ â€œAdd Contacts,â€ and in-app discovery.Our â€œInvite Friendsâ€ enables you to invite others onto the VERO App. You can also find people you know on the VERO App through our â€œAdd Contactsâ€ feature or by searching names and usernames on the VERO App. â€œAdd Contactsâ€ allows you to find contacts either through the contact list on your mobile device or through a search of names and usernames on the VERO App. When you register for an account you have the option to notify other VERO Users in your contact list that you have joined the Service.If you choose to use any of these features, you will be asked to grant us permission to access and collect only the phone numbers from your contact list on your mobile device and such information. Note that we do not collect the names or any other information associated with these phone numbers. You may turn off this access at any time in your profile settings so that we no longer can access your contact list. Additionally regarding the â€œInvite Friendsâ€ feature, you understand that you are directly sending a text or email from your own phone or e-mail accounts. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.If you choose to add your contacts through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on the VERO App.Similarly, when other VERO App users use the â€œAdd Contactsâ€ feature on the VERO App, we will identify you as a VERO App user to that user if your contact information is already in their contact list.




6) Third-Party Data Collection and Online AdvertisingWe do not display third party advertising on the VERO Website, the VERO App, or our other Services. We may, however, allow third-party companies to collect certain information for advertising purposes on certain portions of the VERO Website, or when you interact with ads for our products and services on third party sites (such as by clicking on the ad or downloading our app), in the contexts described further below. Specifically, we permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect information about your use of the VERO Website over time so that they may play or display ads for our products and services on other websites or services you may use, and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, and similar technology, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the VERO Websites, AdID, and other similar information. If permitted by your device settings, they may also collect location data through GPS, Wi-Fi or other methods. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research. We may also use services provided by third parties (such as social media platforms) to serve targeted ads to you and others on such platforms. Â We may engage in the following: Â Social Media Platforms. We may display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other social media forums. These companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics. They may collect information from our website visitors through a first-party pixel, in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience on the social media platform. These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them. If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks. Third Party Partners.Â  We work with certain third-party partners to provide advertising-related services, including on specific portions of the VERO Website. We do this to promote VERO on third party websites. For example, we use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit specific portions of the VERO Website on your browser or mobile device or otherwise engage with us. Â We share a unique identifier with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. Â For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's website, â€œHow Google uses data when you use our partnersâ€™ sites or appsâ€ located atÂ http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can learn about Google Analyticsâ€™ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here:Â https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.Â We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics to advertise our Services to you on third party websites. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the Google Ads advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. Â You may control your advertising preferences or opt-out of certain Google advertising products by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available atÂ Â https://google.com/ads/preferences, or by visiting NAIâ€™s online resources atÂ Â http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.

You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by selecting â€œlimit ad trackingâ€ (iOS) or â€œopt-out of interest-based adsâ€ (Android).Â  You may also be able to opt-out of some â€” but not all â€” interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. Please note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us.Â  It means that the online ads that you do see from DAA program participants should not be based on your interests.Â  We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-partiesâ€™ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs. In addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the DAAâ€™s Principles.7) SecurityWe maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the VERO Website or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the VERO Website or Services, and you do so at your own risk.8) LinksOur Site and Services may contain links to other websites or services or allow others to send you such links.

You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website or service before providing any information to that website or service.9) Childrenâ€™s PrivacyThe VERO Website, the VERO App, and our other Services are intended for users who are 13 years old or older.

HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA5.1 The criteria used to determine the period for which personal information about you will be retained varies depending on the legal basis under which we process the personal information:(a) Contract. Where we are processing personal information based on a contract, we generally will retain your personal information for the duration of the contract plus some additional limited period of time that is necessary to comply with law or that represents the statute of limitations for legal claims that could arise from our contractual relationship.(b)Â Legitimate Interests. Where we are processing personal information based on our legitimate interests, we generally will retain such information for a reasonable period of time in order to fulfil the legitimate interests, taking into account your fundamental interests and your rights and freedoms.(c)Â Consent. Where we are processing personal information based on your consent, we generally will retain your personal information until you withdraw your consent, or otherwise for the period of time necessary to fulfil the underlying agreement with you or provide you with the applicable service for which we process that personal information. With regards to any erasure requests, your account will be removed from the Application and it may take up to one week for your data to be deleted.(d)Â Legal Obligation. Where we are processing personal information based on a legal obligation, we generally will retain your personal information for the period of time necessary to fulfil the legal obligation.(e) Legal Claim. We may need to apply a â€œlegal holdâ€ that retains information beyond our typical retention period where we face threat of legal claim or intent to establish a claim.Â  In that case, we will retain the information until the hold is removed, which typically means the claim or threat of claim has been resolved.6.Â RECIPIENTSWe may share your personal data with the categories of third parties described in the â€œWhen We Share Information with Third Parties"Â section of the main Privacy Policy above as well as at paragraphs 3 and 4 of this addendum (as required in accordance with the uses set out in Annex 1 and Annex 2).7.Â MARKETING7.1 From time to time we may contact you with information about our products and services, including sending you marketing messages and asking for your feedback on our products and services.
