What Products does this Policy cover?
A Meta Quest, a mobile phone showing the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps, and a pair of Ray-Ban Stories glasses sit on a table.
This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide Meta Products, which we also call "Products."

4
Information we collect and receive if you use or interact with our Products but don’t have an account
Even if you don't have an account, you may interact with or use Meta Products[3]. Then we collect things like:

Browser and app logs of your visits to public content, like Facebook Pages, videos and rooms
Basic information about devices[10] that downloaded our apps, like device model and OS
We also receive information using cookies and similar technologies, like the Meta Pixel or Social Plugins, when you visit other websites and apps that use our Business Tools or other Meta Products. Read more about information we receive from partners, vendors and other third parties in this policy and in our Cookies Policy.

Examples of why we collect and receive information
Security of our Products
For example, we collect information to monitor attempted attacks on our systems, such as overloading our servers with traffic. Also, if we see someone without an account trying to load too many pages, they could be trying to scrape our site in violation of our terms. Then we can take action to prevent it.

Safety and integrity
For example, if someone without an account joins a room and shares a harmful video, we can take action according to our Community Standards. We can remove content that violates our terms and policies, or share information with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of death or imminent bodily harm.

Advertising
For example, you may also see ads for the Meta Company Products shown through Meta Audience Network when you visit other apps if we can’t recognize you as a registered user of the Meta Products.

Performance
For example, we collect information when people use our Products, even if they don’t have an account, to measure how fast our pages load in different countries and whether they're working properly. This helps us identify and fix issues with local networks.

5
Information you provide
For example, when you create a Facebook account, you must provide some information, like a password and your email address or phone number. You might choose to add other details to your account, like a profile photo or payment information.

We also collect information you provide when you:

What we collect from our camera feature
A hand holding a mobile phone applies a butterfly Instagram filter to a photo of a flower garden.
José likes using Instagram’s Camera feature to take pictures of his flower garden. We collect information about how José uses the Camera feature. For example, if he chooses a background effect for the photo he’s about to take, we collect information from the camera so we can apply the effect to his photo.

How filters, effects, masks and avatars work
A mobile phone screen of a man taking a selfie with a flower filter applied to the face.
If you use our camera or allow access to photos and videos, on certain Meta Products you can add filters, effects, masks or avatars. Some of these features process parts of faces or bodies within the camera frame, photo or video. Then they can do things like fit a mask correctly over the eyes, nose and mouth. The information we use for this process is used to create the feature. It’s not used to identify you.

What we collect from voice-enabled features
A person using Ray-Ban Stories to take a photo of three friends posing on the beach.
Ren tells Meta’s voice-enabled Assistant to take a photo on smart glasses. A visual indicator shows that Assistant is activated and listening for Ren’s command. We collect this voice interaction, which includes any background sound that occurs when Ren says the command. Collecting Ren’s voice interactions lets us provide and, depending on Ren’s settings, improve the Assistant feature.

7
Metadata
Information about the content itself, like the location where a photo was taken or the date a file was created
Information about the message itself, like the type of message or the date and time it was sent

Or they might use Meta Audience Network tools to monetize their apps by showing ads from businesses that advertise on Facebook.

Why we use information across devices
One reason we use your information across devices[40] is to help us give you a more personalized experience. For example, we might show you an ad on your phone, and later you might use your laptop to click on the ad and buy the product.

Manual review
Examples of when we use manual review
Our reviewers help us promote safety, security and integrity across our Products. For example, reviewers can look for and remove content that violates our terms and policies and keep content that doesn’t break our terms and policies available. Their work supplements our technology that detects violations.
When our algorithms detect that someone might need help, a reviewer can review their post and offer support if needed.
We also use manual review to analyze content to train our algorithms to review content the same way a person would. This improves our automatic processing, which in turn helps us improve our products.
Who reviews this information
Our reviewers work at Meta, for Meta Companies or for a trusted service provider[41]. We require every reviewer who's allowed access to your information to meet privacy and security standards.

Learn more about how Meta prioritizes content for manual review.

28
What Products does this Policy cover?
A Meta Quest, a mobile phone showing the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps, and a pair of Ray-Ban Stories glasses sit on a table.
This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide Meta Products, which we also call "Products."

How we personalize your Facebook Feed
Your Facebook Feed is unique to you. We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can learn more about the different types of signals we use to rank it. We also suggest content that’s relevant to you.

Many things influence the content you see in your Feed.

For example:

If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you. So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you.
If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you. So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you.
If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic. So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball.
You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook. So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium. Learn more about how we use location-related information.

Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store.

If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her Advertisers setting. Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her Ad preferences.

Topics we think you might be interested in
A turntable, a laptop, headphones, and a pair of hands holding a phone that shows an ad for a music festival.
For example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music."

Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication.

Jon can manage his interests in his ad topics.

Your connections
An easel with a painting on it and a hand holding a phone that shows an ad for an art fair.
For example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair. Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair.

31
Other device signals we receive
We receive different types of device signals from different operating systems. They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.

32
IP address
Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.

33
Personalizing ads for you and others
A hand holding a mobile phone that shows a map of an airport.
For example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport. He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks. We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport.

Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore. Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby.

34
Helping to keep your account secure
For example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity. So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you.

35
Partner
A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

36
Information we provide about different types of people
For example, we might tell an advertiser that their ad was seen by women aged 25–34 who live in Madrid and like software engineering.

37
Third party
A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

38
Providing more personalized features, content and suggestions across our Products
For example we can:

Automatically fill in registration information, like your phone number, from one Meta Product when you sign up for an account on a different Product
Let others see and search your name and profile photo across our Products and communicate with you
Show all interactions in one place for content you’ve cross-posted to different Products
39
Using your information if you add accounts to the same Accounts Center
For example, if you follow your favorite team on Instagram, we can more easily suggest that you follow that team’s Page on Facebook.

Learn more about how we use information across accounts if you add accounts to the same Accounts Center.

40
Device
Devices include computers, phones, hardware, connected TVs, Meta Quest and other web-connected devices.

41
Service provider
A person, business, organization or body that provides services to Meta or to our users on behalf of Meta. For example, our service providers do things like investigate suspicious activity and provide customer support.

When you interact with a supervised user
Some accounts are supervised[44]. When you interact with a supervised user, their parent or guardian can see some of your activity and information. This can include information like your username, profile picture and if the supervised user blocked you. On some Products, the supervised user can let their parent or guardian know if they reported you.

Content others share or reshare about you
Who can see or reshare your content
People in your audience can view your content and can choose to share it with others outside your audience, on and off our Products. For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends, they can download, screenshot or reshare it with anyone, on, across or off our Products.

When you comment on a post or react to a photo, your comment or reaction can be seen by anyone who can see the post or photo. This can include people you aren’t connected to. The person who shared the post can also change their audience at any time after you’ve interacted with it.

With integrated partners
You can choose to connect with integrated partners[46] who use our Products. If you do, these integrated partners receive information about you and your activity.

These integrated partners can always access information that’s public on our Products. Learn more about other information they receive and how they handle your information:

When you use an integrated partner’s product or service
Information they receive automatically
When you use an integrated partner’s products or services, they can access:

What you post or share from these products or services
What you use their services to do
Information from and about the device you’re using
The language setting you’ve chosen on our Products
See examples[47] of when an integrated partner might receive your information.

Information they receive with your permission
Sometimes these integrated partners ask you for permission to access certain additional information from your Facebook, Instagram or Messenger account. In their request, they’ll explain what information they’d like to access and let you choose whether to share it.

On Facebook, this includes things like your email address, hometown or birthday. On Instagram, this includes content, like photos and videos, that you’ve shared from your account when the account was set to private.

Learn what happens if you choose to share your friends list, or if your friends choose to share their friends list.[48]

We automatically log when you receive a request from an integrated partner to access your information. These requests to access information are separate from the Apps and Websites access that you manage in your Facebook or Instagram Ad settings or in your mobile device settings.

How long they can access your information
Apps or websites you’ve logged into using Facebook Login or connected to your Instagram account can access your nonpublic information on Meta Products unless it appears to us that you haven’t used the app or website in 90 days. Note that even if an app’s access to your information has expired, it can still retain information you shared with it previously.

We encourage you to visit your Apps and Websites settings from time to time to review which apps and websites continue to have access to your information through Facebook Login or Instagram.

When you interact with someone else’s content on an integrated partner’s product or service
Integrated partners receive information about your activity when you interact with other Facebook, Instagram or Messenger users while they’re using the integrated partner’s product or service.

For example, a gamer livestreams to Facebook using a partner app. Then you comment on that livestream. The app developer will receive information about your comment.

How integrated partners handle your information
Integrated partners handle the information you share with them according to their own terms and policies, not Meta’s. You can review their privacy policy on their website or app to learn how they receive and process your information. In some cases, they use a separate service provider to receive and process your information.

What Products does this Policy cover?
A Meta Quest, a mobile phone showing the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps, and a pair of Ray-Ban Stories glasses sit on a table.
This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide Meta Products, which we also call "Products."

43
Choosing an audience
On Facebook, the audience can be made up of:

The public, including people on and off Facebook
Your friends and other connections, such as the friends of people you tag
A customized list of people
Yourself
The members of a single community, such as a group
On Instagram, you can set the audience for what you share by choosing between a private or public account. With a private account, only followers you approve can see what you share. With a public account, your posts and other content on Instagram can be seen by anyone, on or off our Products, including if they don’t have an account. You can restrict the audience for your content by blocking individual accounts from viewing them. You can also create a close friends list for certain types of content that only the people on that list can see.

Take control
Audience settings

Audience settings are different from app permissions
Your audience settings are different from the permissions you give to individual apps and websites to access your information. Read our policy about how you may share information with integrated partners.

Supervision
Supervision provides supervisors chosen by a teen, like parents and guardians, with tools and insights to help support a teen account.

45
Search engines
You can visit your privacy settings to control whether search engines outside Facebook can link to your profile. But other public content–like if you post with your audience set to Public, or post on public Pages or accounts–might still be accessible through search engines, depending on the settings of that account.

For example, you might use your Facebook login to play an online game with your Facebook friends. The game developer automatically receives information about your activities in the game.

When an integrated partner might receive your information
Hands using a tablet to tap the Like button on a news article.
Or you might use the Facebook Like button on an article posted on a news website. The website developer automatically receives information about your Like on their article.

48
Sharing friends lists
When you share your friends list
If you use Facebook Login to log into an app, the app developer might request access to your list of Facebook friends. Here's what happens if you give the app developer permission to view these lists:

They can view and access a list of your Facebook friends who use the same app and have given the app permission to access their list of friends. They can’t access nonpublic information about your friends or followers through this process. Note that the app developer will receive more information about your friends if your friends choose to share it themselves. They can share it by providing the information directly or giving the developer permission to access information from their account.
You’ll appear on friends lists that your Facebook friends can choose to share with the same app. You can remove this permission, or the app entirely, if you later decide that you don’t want to share your friends list with an app, or don’t want to appear on other friends lists shared with that app.
When your friends share their friends list
Your friends might choose to share their friends lists with app developers through Facebook Login. But your friends can’t use Facebook Login to share nonpublic information about you.

How do we share information with third parties?
Highlights
We share certain information with:

Advertisers who show ads on our Products
Businesses we hire to market our Products for us
Businesses we hire to do things like offer customer service or conduct surveys
Researchers who use it to do things like innovate, advance technology, or improve people’s safety
We don’t sell your information, and we never will.

A row of images, including a bar graph, two ads and an online shopping cart.
We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will. We also require partners[49] and other third parties[50] to follow rules about how they can and cannot use and disclose the information we provide.

Here’s more detail about who we share information with:

Partners
Advertisers and Audience Network publishers
Advertisers
We provide advertisers with reports about the number and kinds of people who see and engage with their ads and commercial content. These reports include information about the general demographics and interests of people who engaged with an advertiser’s ad or commercial content. Then advertisers can better understand their audience. See an example[51].

Meta also provides advertisers and their vendors with information about:

Ads and commercial content people engaged with, if any
When people engaged with ads and commercial content
Where that ad or commercial content was shown (for example, on Instagram, or on Facebook)
We also confirm which ads or commercial content you viewed that led you to take an action with an advertiser, such as downloading an advertiser's app. But we don't share information with these advertisers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you give us permission.[52]

Audience Network publishers and their vendors
Meta Audience Network lets advertisers place ads with us that will be published on other apps and websites outside of Meta.

To help show you ads on their apps and websites, we share information with publishers who use Audience Network, as well as vendors who facilitate that use. For example, we share:

How many people see and engage with ads on publisher apps
Information related to or in response to a publisher’s request to serve an ad on its app.
But we don't share information with these publishers and their vendors that by itself can be used to contact or identify you, such as your name or email address, unless you give us permission[52].

Partners who use our analytics services
People rely on our Products[53], like business accounts, professional tools and Facebook Pages, to run and promote their businesses. Businesses use our analytics services to understand more about how people are using their content, features, products and services.

To provide these services, we use the information we collect about you. We put this information into aggregate reports so that partners can see how well their content, features, products and services are performing and are able to understand things like users’ experience with such content, products and services.

These reports aggregate information like:

How many people interacted with our partners' content, products or services
The general demographics and interests[51] of the people who interacted with it
How people use our partners’ products and services to connect to Meta Products and the performance of their connection and networks
Advertisers also receive other information. Read our Policy about how we share information with advertisers.

Partners who offer goods or services on our Products and commerce services platforms
When you choose to make a transaction[54], or otherwise choose to share information with a seller, creator, fundraiser, charity, payment services provider or commerce services platform[55], we share information with them and with any providers acting on their behalf.

Depending on how you interact with them, they receive:

Information to complete your transaction, like order, payment, contact and shipping information
Information to help ensure the security of the transaction, like information about your device or connection
Any information required by applicable regulation
Other information you choose to share with them
For example, if you make a purchase from an Instagram shop using checkout, the shop will receive information to complete your transaction. This may include your order items, your contact details and shipping information. If the shop uses a payment services provider, such as PayPal, to facilitate the transaction, the provider will receive the transaction amount, a transaction description (to appear on your credit card statement) and your payment card information, such as cardholder name, card number, expiration date and billing address. Learn more about payments on Instagram.

Integrated partners
When you choose to use integrated partners’ products or services, they may receive information about you and your activity. Read the Policy.

Vendors
Measurement vendors
We don’t create every measurement and analytics report ourselves.

We share information (like whether people saw an ad or engaged with it) with our measurement vendors[56], who aggregate it to provide their reports.

For example, an advertiser might ask a measurement vendor to help figure out the impact its ads on Facebook have had on sales. The measurement vendor compares information from us about clicks on the advertiser’s Facebook ads with information from the advertiser about product purchases. Then the measurement vendor creates and provides aggregated reports that show the advertiser how its ads are performing.

Marketing vendors
We share information about you with marketing vendors[57]. For example, we share your device identifier or other identifiers with marketing vendors to help us serve you ads most relevant to your interests.

Marketing vendors support our marketing and advertising efforts by:

Serving our advertisements across the internet, including on mobile, desktop and connected television devices
Tracking and categorizing your online and mobile app activity
Providing us information about your interests and community and advertising interactions
These marketing vendors help us understand who might find our advertising most relevant to their interests, and which of our Products might interest you. This information can be used to personalize which of our ads are shown to you. Marketing vendors also use this information to measure response to our marketing efforts and the effectiveness of our advertising.

Learn more[58] about how to manage the Meta ads you see off our Products.

Service providers
Service providers
Service providers provide services to us that help us provide our Products to you. We share the information we have about you to receive these services, which include:

Investigating suspicious activity
Detecting and stopping threats to our personnel and property
Facilitating payments
Providing customer support
Improving the functionality of our Products
Providing technical infrastructure services
Analyzing how our Products are used
Conducting research and surveys
Marketing and promoting our Products
Third parties
External researchers
We provide information to external researchers. They use it to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation, and to promote safety, security and integrity.

Research goals include supporting:

Our business or mission
Social good. Learn more.
Technological advancement
Safety and security on our Products
Public interest
Health and well-being
When sharing information with external researchers, we ensure the privacy of our users is protected. Learn more about the privacy-safe research we support.

AI integrations
Generative AI models that make our features work may not have the most complete or recent information. That means if you ask Meta AI about the score to yesterday's football game, it might not know the right answer. That's why we work with other trusted companies, like search engine providers, so we can bring you the most relevant information.

Meta sometimes shares the messages you send to our AIs and general information, like your region, with these companies so you can get better results. We don't send personally identifying information, like your username, unless you include it in your messages to the AIs.

These companies have their own privacy policies that describe how they use this information we share. Learn more in our Generative AI topic in Privacy Center, which includes links to these companies’ privacy policies.

Other third parties
We also share information with other third parties[50] in response to legal requests, to comply with applicable law or to prevent harm. Read the Policy.

And if we sell or transfer all or part of our business to someone else, in some cases we’ll give the new owner your information as part of that transaction, but only as the law allows.

49
Partner
A person, business, organization or body using or integrating our Products to advertise, market or support their products and services

50
Third party
A person, business, organization or body that is not part of the Meta Companies

51
General demographics and interests
For example, a bike shop creates a Page on Facebook and wants to place an ad to reach an audience of people in Atlanta interested in cycling. We determine whether someone fits in this audience based on, for example, whether they liked a Page about bikes. Then people in that audience could see the bike shop's ad.

You can see the “interests” assigned to you in your Ad preferences and remove them if you want.

The bike shop can then see reports showing aggregated statistics about the audience seeing their ads and how their ads are performing. The reports would show statistics to the advertiser that, for example, most of the people who saw or clicked on their ad:

Were women
Were between the ages of 25 and 34
Clicked on the ad from their phone
52
When you might give us permission
For example, you might request more information from a business by clicking their ad in your Facebook Feed and submitting a form with your name and contact information. Then the advertiser would receive the information you provided.

53
What Products does this Policy cover?
A Meta Quest, a mobile phone showing the Facebook, Instagram and Messenger apps, and a pair of Ray-Ban Stories glasses sit on a table.
This Policy describes the information we, Meta Platforms, Inc., process to provide Meta Products, which we also call "Products."

We keep information as long as we need it to provide our Products, comply with legal obligations or protect our or other’s interests. We decide how long we need information on a case-by-case basis. Here’s what we consider when we decide:

If we need it to operate or provide our Products. For example, we need to keep some of your information to maintain your account. Learn more[65].
The feature we use it for, and how that feature works. For example, messages sent using Messenger’s vanish mode are retained for less time than regular messages. Learn more[66].
How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations. See some examples[67].
If we need it for other legitimate purposes, such as to prevent harm; investigate possible violations of our terms or policies; promote safety, security and integrity; or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
In some instances and for specific reasons, we’ll keep information for an extended period of time. Read our Policy[68] about when we may preserve your information.

65
If we need it to operate or provide our Products
For example, we keep profile information, photos you’ve posted (and not deleted) and security information for the lifetime of your account.

And when you search for something on Facebook, we keep your search history until you clear the search in your activity log or delete your account. Once you clear a search or delete your account, it will no longer be visible to you, and it will be deleted[69].

But even if you don’t clear your search or delete your account, within six months of your search we delete information about that search that isn’t necessary to show you your search history, like information about the device you were using, or your location.

66
The feature we use it for, and how that feature works
A person at a birthday party, using a phone to send a message in vanish mode.
For example, May is planning a surprise party for Yang. She sends Cynthia the party details in Messenger using vanish mode so that the message will disappear. The message will no longer be visible to May once she leaves the chat, and Cynthia will see the message only the first time she opens the chat thread.

After Cynthia reads the message, the content is deleted after one hour. If Cynthia never reads it, it’s deleted after 14 days.

67
How long we need to retain the information to comply with certain legal obligations
For example, we retain information for as long as we need it for:

A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
A governmental investigation
A legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings
68
Why we may preserve your information longer
Your information, including financial transaction data related to purchases or money transfers made on our Products, may be preserved and accessed for a longer time period if it’s related to any of the following:

A legal request or obligation, including obligations of Meta Companies or to comply with applicable law
A governmental investigation
An investigation of possible violations of our terms or policies
To prevent harm
For safety, security and integrity purposes
To protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products
If it’s needed in relation to a legal claim, complaint, litigation or regulatory proceedings
See some examples[70].

In some cases, we may preserve your information based on the above reasons even after you request deletion of your account or some of your content. We may also preserve information from accounts that have been disabled and content that has been removed for violations of our terms and policies.

69
Delete your information or account
To delete your information, you can:

Find and delete specific information. We offer tools you can use to delete certain information. For example, you can use Delete buttons to delete content you’ve posted to your account. You can also use tools like activity log on Facebook to send content to the trash in bulk. When you delete content, it’s no longer visible to other users. Visit the Facebook Help Center or Instagram Help Center to learn what happens when you delete your content or move it to trash.
Permanently delete your account. If you delete your account on Facebook or Instagram, we delete your information, including the things you’ve posted, such as your photos and status updates, unless we need to keep it as described in "How long do we keep your information?" Once your account is permanently deleted you won’t be able to reactivate it, and you won’t be able to retrieve information, including content you’ve posted.
How long does it take to delete your information?
If you request that we delete your account or content, it may take up to 90 days to delete your information after we begin the account deletion process or receive a content deletion request. After the information is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery.

If you leave your deleted content in your trash on Facebook or your Recently Deleted folder on Instagram, the deletion process will begin automatically in 30 days. Or you can start the deletion process right away by deleting the content from your trash or Recently Deleted folder.

70
Examples of why we might preserve your information
To respond to a legal request
For example, we might preserve your information after you delete your account when we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account.

To comply with applicable law
For example, we preserve certain information about purchases or transactions associated with an account, in line with Meta’s accounting obligations.

For safety, security and integrity purposes
For example, if we disable an account for violating our terms or policies, we preserve information about that user to prevent them from opening a new account.

We also might preserve some of your account information as part of our review of suspicious activity. This includes any suspicious activity associated with our financial products, like suspected money laundering or terrorist funding.

For litigation
We may preserve your information where we deem it necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint. For example, we may be required to defend ourselves in legal proceedings in a claim related to your information.

How our ads system works
Our ads system works in the following way:

We use your information to determine the ad interests most relevant to you. We try to predict your ad interests based on the information we have, including any choices you've made in Ad preferences.
Advertisers tell us which audience they want to reach based on who they think will be most interested. This can include things like age, gender, location where advertisers want to show their ad or interests, such as women, based in Dublin, who like golf.
We review the potential ads that we could show you to identify the most relevant ones. Our ads system automatically reviews all the potential ads where you might fit the audience that advertisers want to reach. For example, you may see potential ads because you match the age range and interest category. We determine which ones to show you based on things like whether it best achieves the advertiser’s goal and is most relevant to you. To do this, we use algorithms and machine learning to order the ads we may show you. We use different factors such as the ad quality, the advertiser's desired audience and budget. We also consider how likely we think it is that you will react to the ad based on things like your activity on Meta Products. Learn more.
All of this information helps us show you the most relevant ads. When you see an ad on Meta Products (e.g. in your Facebook Feed), we use this process to choose the most relevant ad to show you.

IP address
Stands for "internet protocol address." It’s a unique number assigned to a device, like a phone or computer, that allows it to communicate over the internet. Numbers are assigned according to standard guidelines, or protocols.

Just like you need a mailing address to receive a letter from a friend, your device needs an IP address to receive information on the internet.
