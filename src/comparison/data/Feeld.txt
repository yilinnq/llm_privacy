More generally, you may provide us with personal information when you:
sign up to the app and complete your profile;

link accounts together;
communicate with us (whether through the app, online, including via social media, or by email)

Please note that if you create your account using social media login details (e.g. Facebook), you give permission to that social media platform to share with us your name, profile picture and email address.
Special categories of personal data
Some of the personal information you provide us, including sexual orientation, sexual preferences, and certain other information you may choose to provide as part of using the Services (such as information about your race, ethnicity, politics, religion, philosophical beliefs, health and sex life) will be treated as special category personal data to which additional protections apply under data protection law.
We process such special category personal data because you have chosen to submit that information to our Services.Ã‚Â  We will not share this data with anyone other than in accordance with this privacy policy.
When completing your profile, or providing information to other members or to us via the Services, you can provide as much or as little detail as you see fit.
By completing and sharing your profile information relating to your sexual life, you give your consent for us to process this information for the purposes of providing our Services.
You can amend your profile and remove this information at any time if you no longer want to share this information. Ã‚
2.
DATA RETENTION
We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, as well as the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.Ã‚

We may also retain your personal information for a longer period in certain circumstances, including in the event of an on-going complaint, in the context of a criminal, financial or regulatory investigation (or similar), if we consider on-going retention is needed to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of Feeld staff, other users or other third parties, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.

ANNEX 2
FEELD - COOKIE POLICY
We use cookies and similar technologies (Ã¢Â€Âœ
Cookies
Ã¢Â€Â) on our website.Ã‚
What are cookies?
Ã¢Â€ÂœCookiesÃ¢Â€Â are small text files, placed on a computer hard drive, that enable websites to remember a particular device. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently for visitors and to provide web providers with traffic information.Ã‚
Cookies allow the server to deliver personalized pages for users as cookies remember your preferences and make the interaction between you and the website smoother and more efficient. When users load the website, the browser retrieves their previous activity. This allows the browser to keep the user logged in and many other functions that make the navigation more effective.
Without cookies, we may not be able to provide certain services or features, and our website will not work as efficiently as intended. You can turn cookies off, but if you do this, you may not be able to access some of the website.
Setting and storing cookies
Cookies may be set either by the website you are visiting (Ã¢Â€Âœ
First-Party cookies
Ã¢Â€Â) or by third parties that run content on the website you are viewing (Ã¢Â€Âœ
Third-Party cookies
Ã¢Â€Â). They may be stored either for the duration of your visit or for repeat visits.
Different types of cookies
There are four main types of cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies
: These cookies are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use the features of a website, or to provide a service requested by you. We do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these cookies.
Functionality cookies
: These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as username, language, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by using a cookie to store information about the region in which you are currently located. The information these cookies collect remains anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
Performance cookies
: These cookies collect information about how you use a website, (such as identifying which pages you go to most often), and record difficulties you may experience while using the website, such as error messages. All information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve the efficiency of the website.
Targeting cookies or advertising cookies
: These cookies are used to deliver advertisements tailored to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.
