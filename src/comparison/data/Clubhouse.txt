Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyLast updated November 7, 2024Thank you for using Clubhouse!Clubhouse is a social network based on voice. Our products include our iOS and Android apps and our website (our "Productsâ€). Among other things, our Products allow you to use your voice to interact with others in real-time through â€œConversationsâ€ (what we call the different types of audio conversations, including â€œChats,â€ â€œLive Rooms,â€ and â€œVMs,â€ you can have using our Products), and to share recordings of those interactions for others to enjoy (or participate in) later.When you use our Products, you provide personal information to us. We wrote this privacy policy (the â€œPrivacy Policyâ€ or â€œPolicyâ€) to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we use it and disclose it, how long we retain it, and what choices you have about it. This Policy does not cover information that does not identify you. Nor does it cover the practices of Clubhouse users. Users who listen to you speak on Clubhouse, or view information you share on Clubhouse, might save that information outside of our Products using other tools.You may have specific privacy rights in your state or region. In the United States, residents of California and other states have specific privacy rights. Residents of the European Economic Area (â€œEEAâ€), the UK, Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and other jurisdictions also have specific rightsResidents of California can find our California Consumer Privacy Act disclosures here.Residents of the EEA, the UK, and Brazil can find our Notice to EEA, UK, and Brazilian Data Subjects here.Residents of Europe who are not Clubhouse users can find our Non-User Data Notice here.These additional disclosures supplement, and should be read together with, this Privacy Policy.Table of ContentsInformation We CollectHow We Use The Information We CollectHow We Disclose The Information We CollectHow Long We Keep InformationManaging Your InformationTransferring InformationRevisionsContact UsCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act DisclosuresNotice to European and Brazilian Data SubjectsInformation For European Data Subjects Who Have Not Used Our ProductsCustom Voice Privacy NoticeData Processor List1. Information We CollectA. Information You ProvideWhen you use Clubhouse, we collect personal information that you provide to us. This includes:Account InformationWhen you set up an account, we may ask you to provide information about yourself, including your name, phone number, email address, and date of birth. If you use our Products as a guest without setting up an account, we may ask you to provide your name, phone number or other information.Biographical InformationWe may also ask you to provide us with some additional personal information about you that will be visible in our Products, such as topics that interest you (â€œInterestsâ€), a profile picture, and a bio in your profile to tell others more about you. When you change your profile picture we store a copy of the new picture you upload and retain all profile pictures you uploaded previously for trust and safety purposes and in accordance with our data retention policies.Social Media And Contact InformationYou may choose to connect your other social media accounts, or sync your contacts.B. Information We Get When You Use Our ProductsWhen you use our Products, we collect additional personal information based on your activity and other personal information you might choose to provide. This includes:Audio ConversationsChats. Chats are audio conversations you can have on Clubhouse that occur asynchronously with other users, and which may also contain attachments like links or images. With Chats, the content you create can be shared with groups of users or user networks more publicly. (As detailed in our Terms of Service). Chats will appear in other usersâ€™ â€œfeedsâ€ and in other parts of the app, and in some cases may be shared by other users outside of Clubhouse. Chats are shared with others according to the privacy settings of the user that created the Chat (the â€œChat Creatorâ€). This means you can share Chats you create with other users. We retain your Chats indefinitely, unless you delete them, so that they can be played back by other users. A full Chat conversation may be deleted by the Chat Creator, or a specific audio comment (a section of an audio Chat or VM) within a conversation may be deleted by the person who created it. A â€œHouseâ€ is a community you can join with users, where you can participate in Chats and Live Rooms, and interact in different ways.Voice Messages (â€œMessagesâ€ or â€œVMsâ€ ). Direct voice messages, which we call â€œMessagesâ€ or â€œVMsâ€ are voice conversations allowing you to send audio content directly to one person or a group of people (unlike Chats, which are voice conversations that you may share in your feed to groups of users, such as your friends, friends-of-friends, or other House members ). These conversations may also contain attachments like links or images. For VMs, content is recorded and remains available unless a conversation participant deletes a specific item of content (such as a segment) they have created. If you start a VM, or participate in a VM with one or more users, those users may appear in the â€œRecently Chatting Withâ€ section of your profile, which will be displayed to your friends. Friends who visit your profile may press on a userâ€™s photo (or group of user photos) that is displayed in the â€œRecently Chatting Withâ€ section to start a separate, new group conversation with you and the other user(s).Live conversations (â€œLive Roomsâ€). Live Rooms are conversations where you interact with other users in real time using your voice and other features provided within Live Rooms.We record all Live Rooms so that we can investigate any complaints regarding violations of our Community Guidelines or our Terms of Service, or otherwise illegal or illicit activity. This is part of our commitment to users under our Terms of Service to work to provide a safe space for their Conversations and combat illegal and harmful conduct and content. If we receive a complaint while the Room is live, we will review the recording to determine whether a violation has occurred. We will retain the recording as long as reasonably necessary to identify and investigate potential violations.In Live Rooms that are open to all users, we may also generate transcripts of the Conversation to analyze the contents of the Conversation and use that information to personalize our Products (â€œTranscriptsâ€).Replays. We record conversations that occur in Live Rooms and make them available to other users where the Room creator instructs us to do so by enabling the â€œReplayâ€ feature. When Replays are enabled, the recording will be stored by Clubhouse and may be made available to other users on Clubhouse at the Room creatorâ€™s instruction. Replays may also be available outside of Clubhouse.Usage And Activity InformationWe collect information about when and how you use our Products. Among other things, this includes Transcripts of Conversations; information about Conversations; Conversations you create; Conversations you participate in; Conversations you join; and Replays you create. It also includes who you follow, what Houses or communities you create or join, web pages you visit, links you share, content you share to other platforms through integrations (i.e. social sharing), queries you submit, and what kind of content youâ€™re interested in.Text MessagesWe store text-based messages you send to and receive from other users and information about those messages, including the messages you send via Room Chat or other messaging features in the Products, including historical Backchannel conversations. We review the contents of these messages if a user reports, or we otherwise detect, a potential trust and safety violation or potentially illegal or illicit activity.Other CommunicationsWe collect information about the messages you send us when you contact us with questions or feedback, including the contents of those messages.ContactsIf you give us permission to sync your contacts, we will store identifiers known as hash values derived from the phone numbers of your contacts, and we will update your contacts periodically. Similarly, if you invite somebody to join Clubhouse, we will store a hash value derived from the phone number you provide. We do not collect names, email addresses, or any other information associated with your contacts.Voice Samples And Text-To-Speech FunctionsWe may offer a text-to-speech function that lets you convert text into speech to share in Conversations. If you enable this function, we may ask you to provide voice samples, which we will collect and store to create a â€œCustom Voiceâ€ associated with your profile. Depending on your location, applicable laws may define the data used to create your Custom Voice as a biometric identifier or biometric information. Please review our Custom Voice Privacy Notice for details.Log Data And Device InformationWe may collect information from and about the devices you use. In particular, we may collect information about log-in authentication attempts and successful authentications, your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, and information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.Cookie InformationWe use cookies (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Clubhouse account or your browser) to get log data. Some of these cookies are used to help us understand how you use our Products, how many people use our service, and how they use it. Other cookies are used to help us track the efficiency of our advertising campaigns on other platforms. For more detailed information about cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.Web and Logged-out ActivityIf you visit any web pages on Clubhouse, with or without being logged into an account; or, if you participate in Clubhouse features or create content as a guest (i.e., where we do not require you to log in or have a registered account), we may collect and retain information associated with you, including identifiers such as your name or phone number, device information, session information, details of your activity, cookies, or other information.C. Information From Third PartiesSocial Media InformationIf you link your Clubhouse account to X (Twitter), Instagram, or any other social media services, we may receive information from those other services. The information we receive will depend on the privacy settings on those other services.Service ProvidersWe may also receive information about you from our service providers.D. Information About GuestsWe may allow you to use our Products to a limited extent without opening an account, such as by allowing you to join a Conversation (which may include a Chat or a Live Room) or a House for a limited amount of time using a link, contributing audio content to a Conversation, or accepting invitations for Conversations scheduled for a future date. By choosing to use our Product without an account, you agree that you will comply with our Terms of Service Community Guidelines, and any other policies Clubhouse makes available in order to maintain the safety of our Products. We will only allow you to do so if you agree to our Terms like any other user must. Similarly, all provisions of our Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines apply to you the same as they do for any other user.E. Information About Non-UsersClubhouse users may sync their contact lists to Clubhouse in order to help Clubhouse connect them to existing users, invite new users, and to connect users and their contacts with one another on Clubhouse. Similarly, users may send people invitations through various methods, including manually entering a telephone number, posting an invitation, and sharing a link. In either case, the only information Clubhouse stores is a hash value derived from the phone number. Clubhouse does not collect names or any other information associated with your contacts, and we do not share the hash values we collect or make them available to others.For more information, please review our Non-User Data Notice.2.

This is also the case for anyone that we disclose your personal information to and who carries out services on our behalf. In general, this means we will retain your personal information for as long as you have a Clubhouse account.For users located in the EEA, the UK or Brazil, youâ€™ll find specific data retention periods for the different purposes of processing under Justifications for Data Processing in the Notice to European and Brazilian Data Subjects.We may delete some personal information earlier based on changes to your account settings, such as if you instruct us to delete your Contacts. When we no longer need to use your personal information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, weâ€™ll remove any information that can identify you from our systems.As explained above, we record conversations in Live Rooms so that we can investigate any complaints we might receive relating to violations of our Community Guidelines, our Terms of Service, or otherwise illegal or illicit activity.We will retain the recording as long as reasonably necessary to identify and investigate potential violations.Â  When we generate Transcripts for Live Rooms that are open to all users, we will retain those Transcripts for as long as we need them to personalize our Products.We also record Conversations and make them available to other users where the creator instructs us to do so. For Chats, content is recorded and remains available to other users according to the Chat creatorâ€™s preferences, unless the Chat creator deletes the entire Chat conversation, or a conversation participant deletes a specific item of content (i.e., an audio comment) they have created. For VMs, content is recorded and remains available unless a conversation participant deletes a specific item of content (i.e., an audio comment) they have created. For Live Rooms, the Room creator can opt to record the content of the Room by enabling the â€œReplayâ€ feature. When Replays are enabled, the recording will be stored by Clubhouse and may be made available to other users on Clubhouse or other people outside of Clubhouse. Replays are created and saved at the direction of Room creators, and remain available unless the Room creator instructs us to remove the Replay.If an item of content is deleted by its creator, we may retain a copy of it temporarily in storage, but will delete it from our backups within a reasonable amount of time.5.

This Notice provides information about our use of Non-User data to data subjects in the EU and the UK.What information about Non-Users does Clubhouse store?As noted in our Privacy Policy, Clubhouse users can choose to sync their contacts. This allows us to help Clubhouse users connect with people they might know, and to invite new people to Clubhouse more easily. Similarly, a user may choose to send an invitation to a specific person entering that personâ€™s phone number. This could be an invitation to join Clubhouse, or an invitation to join a specific House or Room that the user thinks you might be interested in. If you are listed in the contacts of a Clubhouse user who chooses to sync contacts, or a user decides to send you an invitation by entering your phone number, we may process your phone number even if you are not a Clubhouse user.Either way, Clubhouse does not store your phone number in a readable format. Instead we generate a cryptographic hash value derived from your phone number, and update this information from time to time. We store the hash value in a list linked to the Clubhouse user who chose to sync contacts or send an invitation. Clubhouse does not collect names or any other information from a userâ€™s contacts.What does Clubhouse do with Non-Usersâ€™ Information?We use the hash values derived from phone numbers to help users connect with one another on Clubhouse (now or later), suggest people to invite, and send invitations. If you join Clubhouse, we will use the hash value derived from your phone number to help other Clubhouse users connect with you on Clubhouse.Does Clubhouse Disclose Non-User information to third parties?Clubhouse does not disclose Non-User information to anyone other than our users and our third-party service providers.What is Clubhouseâ€™s legal justification for processing this information?We rely on our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of our users and Non-Users. More specifically, we rely on our legitimate interests in personalizing the Clubhouse Products by connecting users with people they may know on Clubhouse. We rely on the interests of our users in more efficiently connecting with people they may know on Clubhouse, and their interest in inviting others to join Clubhouse to form an even more robust community. We also rely on the interests of Non-Users in finding people they may know on Clubhouse upon joining, and gaining access to specific content on Clubhouse via invitations sent by Clubhouse users.How long does Clubhouse retain Non-User information?When we collect Non-Usersâ€™ phone numbers, we donâ€™t store them. We process them for no more than a few seconds to create cryptographic hash values derived from the phone numbers. The cryptographic hash values are stored in a list on Clubhouse servers linked to the Clubhouse users who uploaded the phone numbers from which the hash values were derived.If a user syncs her contacts, we keep this list of hash values for as long as the user instructs us to do so.If a user invites you to join Clubhouse by entering your phone number manually but does not invite you to join a specific House, we keep the hash value derived from your phone number for no more than 14 days.If a user invites you to join a specific House by entering your phone number manually, we keep the hash value derived from your phone number for no more than 180 days.How do Non-Users exercise their data subject rights?Data subjects have the right to access, rectify, and erase their information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of their personal information, in certain circumstances.

A Clubhouse custom voice allows you to convert your text to spoken words to help you participate in audio conversations when you donâ€™t want to (or canâ€™t) speak aloud. You can use a pre-configured generic voice when you use the custom voice feature, or you can choose to create your own personal custom voice that will make your text replies sound like you are speaking (a â€œCustom Voiceâ€). This notice explains how Clubhouse collects, uses, shares, retains, deletes, and otherwise handles (collectively, â€œprocessesâ€) your voice recordings choose to activate the Custom Voice feature.By activating the Custom Voice feature and selecting â€œcontinueâ€ where prompted, you consent to the practices described in this notice. If you change your mind later, you can delete your Custom Voice at any time in your account settings, and. we will apply your preferences going forward.How does Clubhouse create my personal custom voice?When you activate the Custom Voice feature, Clubhouse will request voice sample(s) to create your personal Custom Voice. We will analyze your voice recordings and create a unique text-to-speech model that you can use to convert written text into audio that mimics your voice. Clubhouse does not use your voice recordings or your Custom Voice to uniquely identify you. Nevertheless, depending on your location, applicable laws might define your Custom Voice as a biometric identifier, biometric information, or biometric data. Depending on your location, we rely on your consent as the legal basis to process your voice recordings for the purposes listed in this notice.Who has access to my personal custom voice?Clubhouse shares your voice recordings with a service provider (identified in our Data Processor List) who analyzes those recordings to create the text-to-speech model that powers your personal custom voice. Limited Clubhouse personnel may also access your voice recordings and personal custom voice as needed for product support, improvement, or compliance purposes.How long is my personal custom voice retained?Clubhouse retains your Custom Voice so long as you maintain an active account with us or until you delete your Custom Voice, unless we are required by law (such as a warrant or subpoena) to keep your personal custom voice for a longer period. If your Clubhouse account remains inactive for three consecutive years, we will automatically delete your Custom Voice. When your Custom Voice is deleted (either because you asked us to or you havenâ€™t used your account in three years), it is permanently erased such that the date cannot be recovered or reconstructed.Additional Privacy Disclosures and Your RightsFor more information about the identity and contact details of the controller, how and why we process your personal information, the legal bases for processing, the data recipients, your rights and choices concerning our data practices, and our cross-border data transfers, please review our Privacy Policy available at https://privacy.clubhouse.com/.
