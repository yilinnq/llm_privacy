Please Note:

User Contributions

You may provide information to be published or displayed or otherwise "posted" on public areas of the Services or transmitted to other users of the Services or third parties (collectively, "User Contributions"). If you wish to use the App to record video or audio User Contributions, the App may request your permission to access your device's camera and/or microphone. Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. You may set certain privacy settings for such information by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the Site with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Also, If you wish to invite your contacts to the Services or send them content from the Services, this includes importing or manually entering your contact list from your device to the Services when authorized by you. We may also receive PI about you from others when they import or sync their contacts with our Services.

Use of Face Data in the App

We use Banuba Face AR SDK (“Banuba”) technology to create Face AR effects within the App. We do not collect any data derived from user images or facial geometry (“Face Data”) during the Face AR effects process. Banuba allows for real-time filter processing during a short-video recording. The exclusive use of this Face Data is to provide our users features such as those available on GTok. The Banuba algorithms work offline and all Face Data processing occurs on the user’s device. No information used by the Banuba ever leaves the user’s device. We do not collect Face Data or share Face Data with any third parties. We do not store or retain any of the Face Data which the Banuba technology utilizes. Since we do not collect, share, or store Face Data we do not have any specific policies relating to the collection, storage, or deletion of Face Data. For more information about Banuba technologies you may visit https://www.banuba.com/faq/data-collection-processing.

Further to the above, as part of GETTR’s premium subscription, GETTR offers a feature that enables its users to create an AI avatar (the “AI Avatar”). GETTR’s AI Avatar feature involves a secure, multi-step process designed to respect user’s privacy. When a user uploads a photo through GETTR's frontend interface, it is transmitted to our Avatar service via our secure Core backend API, all of which are hosted on GETTR's servers. During this process, our system utilizes open-source AI models to perform face detection and NSFW checks to ensure the uploaded photo does not contain erroneous or harmful content. Importantly, no facial data is stored in our system for the creation of the AI Avatar. We may retain information related to the position of the detected face (i.e., bounding box), which does not include any facial key points or data that could be used to reconstruct the user's face. If the photo passes these checks, it is securely transmitted to Replicate https://replicate.com/ for AI processing on a private server. All AI processing is performed using open-source AI models, and no third-party apps or models are involved. Once AI processing is complete, the AI images are sent back to our Avatar Service, and the original photo is permanently deleted from Replicate's private server. Both the AI images and original photos are stored on GETTR's media servers. It's important to note that GETTR employees and admins may access these images solely for quality assurance purposes, and users retain the ability to permanently delete all photos and related AI images at any time, ensuring their full and complete control over their data.

3. COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

As you navigate through and interact with our Services, we may use automatic data collection technologies such as cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and later developed (collectively, "Tracking Technologies") to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns, including:

Details of your visits to our Services, including traffic data, logs, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Site.
Information about your computer or device and internet connection, including your operating system and browser type.
Tracking Technologies helps us to improve our Services and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to: (1) Estimate our audience size and usage patterns, (2) Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our Site according to your individual interests, (3) Speed up your searches, and (4) Recognize you when you return to our Site.

Cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit here, but please know we cannot take responsibility for the completeness or accuracy of this or any third-party information.

Many advertisers and service providers that may perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising for DAA members, visit here. Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see here. Please be aware that, even if you can opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (from other ad networks, for example). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (mobile app, for example), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.

Analytics. We may use Third-Party Services such as Google Analytics to help us analyze our performance and our delivery of Services and advertising to you. You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by going to here and following the instructions.

4. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION

We keep the categories of personal information described above for as long as is necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise authorized by law. This generally means holding the information for as long as one of the following apply:

Your personal information is reasonably necessary to manage our operations, to manage your relationship with us, or to satisfy another purpose for which we collected the information;
Your personal information is reasonably necessary to carry out a disclosed purpose that is reasonably compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected;
The information is reasonably required to protect or defend our rights or property (which will generally relate to applicable laws that limit actions in a particular case); or
We are otherwise required or permitted to keep your information by applicable laws or regulations.
Where information is used for more than one purpose, we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires. For more information about our retention policies, please contact us using the contact details in the “How to Contact Us” section.

5. SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (we refer to each of them as a "Promotion"), including any Promotion jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting your information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including personal information, may be disclosed to GETTR, Promotion co- sponsors, service providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (on a winners list, for example). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices that will take precedence over those contained in our Privacy Policy in case of a conflict. Please review those official rules carefully.

6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES AND AI CHATBOT

A. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and other websites, locations, platforms, applications, or services operated by third parties (collectively, "Third-Party Services") such as third-party social networks ("Social Features"). Examples of Social Features include enabling you to connect the Services to a Third-Party Service to pull or push information to or from the Services. If you use Social Features, and potentially other Third-Party Services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed on the Services or by the Third-Party Services that you use. If you post information on a Third-Party Service that references the Services (by using a hashtag associated with our family of affiliated companies in a tweet or status update, for example), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or otherwise by our family of affiliated companies. GETTR and third parties may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Services.

B. AI Chatbot Interaction and Data Use: In our commitment to enhancing user experience on GETTR, we have implemented an AI Chatbot API, which involves collecting text inputs from users to facilitate real-time automated interactions and responses. GETTR shares the text inputs from its users with two Third-Party Services for limited purposes only. For moderation and text generation, these text inputs are shared with OpenAI, while for analytics purposes, data is shared with ContextAI. Your text inputs are shared with OpenAI to generate appropriate responses and to moderate content in line with our community standards. Data sent to ContextAI is used to analyze user interactions with the chatbot, helping us understand usage patterns and to improve our Services. We prioritize your privacy by implementing stringent data sharing processes, ensuring responsible handling of your data in line with our privacy standards outlined herein. You have the option to opt out of this data processing, which might limit your interaction with the chatbot. We maintain robust security measures to protect your data and retain it only as long as necessary for the purposes stated here. As a user, you have full rights over your data, including access, rectification, or deletion, and you can inquire about its usage. We may update this policy to reflect changes in our AI Chatbot's use; significant changes will be communicated and effective from the specified date. For queries or concerns, please contact privacy@gettr.com.

C. Google reCAPTCHA: "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") is implemented on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). Based on our legitimate interest in preventing spam and abuse, we also use Google's invisible reCAPTCHA feature on our website. This feature is primarily used to distinguish whether information is input by a natural person or involves abusive activity or spam through automated processing. reCAPTCHA analyzes and collects various information from the respective visitor, such as IP address, cookies, user mouse movements, length of stay on the website, etc. When using reCAPTCHA, data may be transferred to Google and other third parties in the process of determining whether the visitor is a human or an automated program. The use of reCAPTCHA is subject to Google's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. You can read what data Google collects and what these data are used for here. You can read the terms of use for Google's services and products here.

B. Opting Out of Providing Personal Information Through the Apps. You may be able to enable or disable certain permissions features (allowing the App to read, modify, or delete the contents of your USB storage; take pictures and videos; or view Wi-Fi connections, for example) by adjusting the permissions in your device. If you no longer want to provide any information to us through the Apps, you may uninstall them from your device.

C. Accessing and Changing Information. We may provide web pages, other mechanisms or processes allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the personal information that we collect from you, and potentially certain other information about you (profile and account information, for example). We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all your information or public postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter. We reserve the right to retain data: (a) as required by laws that apply to us; and (b) except when the laws that apply to us do not allow, for so long as we need it to reasonably achieve the purposes for which your data is maintained.

8. LINKS AND OTHER SITES Our Privacy Policy applies only to our information practices on the Services. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to the other websites and social media websites you access and use, including those you may access from the Services. Other websites or apps may have their own privacy policies or notices that you should review to understand how they may collect, use, or disclose your personal information. GETTR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any linked websites that it does not control.

9. SECURITY We take steps to help protect your personal information. We require password protection as well as physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information. We limit access to personal information to employees and authorized users who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our Services.

We may process your personal information for targeted advertising and some of the ways that we disclose personal information may constitute a sale (as the term is defined in the applicable state privacy laws).

If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut, you have the right to submit certain requests relating to your personal information as described below. To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request to privacyrights@gettr.com or GETTR USA, Inc., ATTN: Privacy Rights, GETTR USA, Inc., c/o The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange St, Wilmington, DE 19801. Please note that we will need to authenticate your identity before your request can be processed. For authentication, we may require you to provide sufficient information to reasonably verify you are the consumer about whom we collected personal information. This verification process may include providing us at least two unique data points, depending on the type of request. If you choose to exercise any of the privacy rights described below, you will not receive discriminatory treatment from us. This means that we will not deny providing our products or services to you, charge you different prices or provide a different level or quality of products or services to you unless those differences are related to the value of your personal information. Residents of Virginia, Colorado, and Connecticut have the right to exercise privacy rights via an authorized agent who meets the agency requirements of the law. Authorized agent requests must include a copy of the agency agreement between the authorized agent and the consumer. We will ask you to independently confirm the agency relationship if this section applies to you.

D. Your Nevada Privacy Rights. Under Nevada law, Nevada residents may opt out of the sale of certain "covered information" collected by operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered information, as "sale" is defined by such law, and we do not have plans to sell this information. However, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell Personal Information covered by this Nevada law, please email your name and email address to privacyrights@gettr.com. You are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes. We will maintain this information and contact you if our plans change. At that time, we will create a process for verifying your identity and providing an opportunity to verified consumers to complete their opt-out. Please become familiar with our Privacy Policy. We may share your data as explained in our Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your experience and our Services, and those activities will be unaffected by a Nevada do not sell request. You may also have other choices regarding our data practices as set forth elsewhere in our Privacy Policy.
