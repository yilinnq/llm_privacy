Hey there! Welcome to OkCupid’s Privacy Policy.

We know reading a privacy policy might not be everyone’s idea of a good time, but hear us out. We put a lot of effort into making this policy as clear and engaging as possible because we actually want you to read it! Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your beverage of choice, and let’s dive into the world of personal data together. 

 

This Privacy Policy applies from January 16th, 2025. The previous version, available here, applies until then.

MTCH Technology Services Limited

OkCupid

1 Hatch Street Upper 

Dublin 2

2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies
This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events, and other services we operate under the OkCupid brand. Whether you're searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our “service” in this Privacy Policy.

If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- will apply.

 
3. Data We Collect
It goes without saying, that we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google, or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you're interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.

 

Data you give us
Categories	Description

Account Data	When you create an account, you give us basic information for your account to be set up such as your phone number, email address, date of birth, and password.

Profile Data	When you complete your profile, you share additional details about yourself, such as your gender, interests, preferences, approximate location, etc. Some of this data may be considered sensitive or special in certain countries, such as details about sexual orientation, sexual life, racial or ethnic origins, or political affiliations. If you choose to provide this data, you consent to us using it as laid out in this Privacy Policy.

Content	When you use our service, you may post photos, videos, audio, text, and other types of content, such as your chats with other members.

Purchase Data	When you make a purchase, we keep the details of the transaction (e.g., what you purchased, the date of the transaction, and the price). The exact data depends on the payment method you choose. When you pay directly with us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide your debit or credit card number or other financial info.

Marketing, Survey, and Research Data	We sometimes run (i) surveys, focus groups, or market studies for research purposes and (ii) promotions, events, or contests for marketing purposes. When you choose to participate, you give us information to process your entry and participation, as well as your responses to our questions and your feedback. 

Third-Party Data	When you choose to share with us information about other people (for example, if you use the contact details of someone you know for a given feature or if you submit a query or report involving a member), we process this data on your behalf to complete your request. 

Customer Support Data	
When you contact us, you provide us with information that may be necessary to help address your inquiry. Other people may also submit queries or reports involving you. Finally, our moderation tools and teams can collect additional data as part of their investigations.

Further, we are part of the Match Group family of businesses. Match Group considers the safety and security of members a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your data may be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our service. 

Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our members’ safety and security.


Social Media Data	You may decide to share data with us through your accounts on other platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Google), for instance, if you decide to create and log into your account via these platforms or if you decide to upload data such as photos onto our service from these platforms.
 

Data generated or automatically collected
Categories	Description

Usage Data	Using the service generates data about your activity, including how you use it (e.g., when you logged in, features you’ve been using, actions taken, the information shown to you, referring webpages, ads you interacted with) and how you interact with others (e.g., searching, matching, communicating). We may also receive data related to interactions you had with our ads on third-party’s websites or apps.

Technical Data	Using the service involves the collection of data from and about the device(s) you use to access our service, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, app settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs, and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser. For more information about cookies, see our Cookie Policy. 
 

Other data we collect with your permission/consent
Categories	Description

Geolocation Data	If you give us permission, we can collect your geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. If you decline permission, features that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.

Face Geometry Data	You may choose to participate in certain of our features like Photo Verification, that involve the collection of face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions. Learn more about our verification feature and how we process your face geometry data.

ID Data	You may provide us with a copy of your government-issued ID to help us check that you’re who you say you are.

6. How Match Group Companies Work Together

OkCupid is part of the Match Group family of businesses.

We may share data about you with our Affiliates and they may share data about you with us, for the reasons laid out below:

To make all Match Group platforms safer, for instance by searching for and identifying bad actors and how they operate across Match Group platforms, as well as making sure that when a bad actor is found on one Match Group platform (for instance ours), they can be banned from all.
To assist each other in data processing operations, as service providers. This assistance may include processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing, targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting, legal support, payment processing, service improvement, data security, and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, and other wrongdoings.
To improve your chances of building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.  We will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.
Where and as allowed under applicable law, to better understand how people use Match Group services overall, to personalize your experience across Match Group services, and to enhance marketing and advertising campaigns.
For other legitimate business purposes including corporate/consolidated audit, analysis, and reporting.
Learn more about how Match Group companies work together.

 

7. Cross-Border Data Transfers
Because we operate a global service, the sharing of your data laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other countries that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, or other countries whose data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental bodies, we typically rely on what is called standard

contract clauses. These standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data. Contact us for a copy.

8. Your Rights
We want you to be in control of your data, so we want to remind you of the following rights, options, and tools available to you. Depending on where you live, you may not have the same rights or they may be named differently. If you have any questions about your rights and how to exercise them, please contact us here.

 

Your Rights	How to exercise it
Access, Portability or To Know

Right to be informed of the personal data we process about you and/or ask for a copy of it

You can access and review some data directly by logging into your account. You can also retrieve a copy of your data by following the process explained here.
Rectification or Correction 

Right to amend or update your personal data where it’s inaccurate or incomplete

You can update your data directly within the service by simply updating your profile. If you wish to rectify other data, please contact us here.
Deletion or Erasure

Right to delete personal data

You can delete some of the data you provided us directly within the service. You can also close your account as explained here and we’ll delete your data as laid out in this Privacy Policy. In any event, you can always contact us here.
Objection (Opt-out) or Restriction

Right to object to us processing personal data or to request that we temporarily or permanently stop processing personal data

You can directly opt out from certain of your personal data processing in your account settings. Otherwise, you can contact us here should you wish to object to or restrict a data processing we’ve listed throughout this Privacy Policy.
Consent Withdrawal
Right to withdraw consent you’ve given us to process your personal data for a specific purpose	You can directly withdraw consent you’ve given us either by updating your account settings or removing Device Permissions you’ve agreed to in your device settings (e.g., access to specific types of device data such as phone contacts, pictures, advertising identifiers, and location services or consent to receive push notifications). When you withdraw consent, certain services may lose functionality. You can always contact us here for more information.
 
For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you for information to verify your identity or authority to act on behalf of a member before we can answer the above requests. We wouldn’t want someone else to get in control of your data! 

Keep in mind that we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, such as a copy of any messages you received from them, the other member will have to make a request themselves.

If you are a resident of Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Texas, Oregon, Montana, Virginia, Colorado, or Connecticut, USA, if we deny your privacy request, you may be able to appeal by contacting us, and explicitly referencing “Privacy Request Appeal.” If you have concerns about the result of your appeal, you may contact the attorney general for your state.]

In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right a judicial remedy and to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal data. You can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here and in the United Kingdom here. The data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work, or where an alleged infringement took place.

9. How Long We Retain Your Data
We want the connections you make through our service to last forever, but we keep your personal data only as long as necessary for legitimate business reasons (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law. 

If you decide to stop using our service, you can close your account and your profile will no longer be visible to other members. Note that we will close your account automatically if you are inactive for two years. 

Following account closure, we delete your data as laid out below: 

To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure or two years following an account ban. During this period, we keep your data to investigate unlawful or harmful conduct. The retention of data during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.
We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction, and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consent members give us for five years to comply and evidence our compliance with applicable law.
We maintain limited data based on our legitimate interest: we kept customer care records and supporting data as well as the imprecise location of download/purchase for five years in support of our safety efforts, to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.
Finally, we maintain data on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep data in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.
Where and as legally permitted, we may maintain and use data that, by itself, cannot identify or be attributed specifically to you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including to improve our service, create new features, technologies, and services, and keep Match Group services safe.

10. Children's Privacy
Our service is restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a member is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.

11. Privacy Policy Changes
This policy may change over time. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations of our data practices remain up-to-date. We will notify you before material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.
