Think of us as your digital wingmate, here to guide you through the ins and outs of what data we collect, and why and how we use it. So get cozy, grab your beverage of choice, and letâ€™s dive into the world of personal data together.This Privacy Policy applies from October 30, 2024.

Where This Privacy Policy AppliesThis Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the Hinge brand. Whether you're searching for your soulmate, joining us at one of our events, or using any of our other awesome services, this Policy has got you covered. For simplicity, we just refer to all of these as our â€œserviceâ€ in this Privacy Policy.If for some reason, one of our services requires its own separate privacy policy, then that policy will be made available to you and that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- will apply.3. Data We CollectIt goes without saying, we canâ€™t help you develop meaningful connections without you providing some information about yourself, like basic profile details and the types of people youâ€™d like to meet. Using our service also generates some information, such as when you logged in and how you used the service. We may also collect data from third parties, like when you access the service through an account you have on another platform (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or when you upload information from your account on another platform to complete your profile. If you're interested in all the details, be sure to check out the table below.Data you give usDescriptionAccount DataWhen you create an account, you give us basic information for your account to be set up such as your phone number, email address, and date of birth.Profile DataWhen you complete your profile, you share additional details about you, such as your gender, interests, preferences, approximate location, etc. Some of this data may be considered sensitive or special in certain countries, such as details about sexual orientation, sexual life, health, racial or ethnic origins, religious beliefs or political affiliations. If you choose to provide this data, you consent to us using it as laid out in this Privacy Policy.ContentWhen you use our service, you may post photos, videos, audio, text and other types of content, such as your chats with other members.Purchase DataWhen you make a purchase, we keep the details of the transaction (e.g. what you purchased, the date of the transaction, and the price). The exact data depends on the payment method you choose. When you pay directly with us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide your debit or credit card number or other financial info.Marketing, Survey and Research DataWe sometimes run (i) surveys, focus groups, or market studies for research purposes and (ii) promotions, events or contests for marketing purposes. When you choose to participate, you give us information to process your entry and participation, as well as your responses to our questions and your feedback.Third-Party DataWhen you choose to share with us information about other people (for example, if you use the contact details of someone you know for a given feature or if you submit a query or report involving a member), we process this data on your behalf to complete your request.Customer Support DataWhen you contact us, you provide us with information that may be necessary to help address your enquiry. Other people may also submit queries or reports involving you. Finally, our moderation tools and teams can collect additional data as part of their investigations. Further, we are part of the Match Group family of businesses. Match Group considers the safety and security of members a top priority. If you were banned from another Match Group service, your data may be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our service.Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our membersâ€™ safety and security.Data generated or automatically collectedDescriptionUsage DataUsing the service generates data about your activity, including how you use it (e.g., when you logged in, features youâ€™ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages, ads you interacted with) and how you interact with others (e.g., searching, matching, communicating). We may also receive data related to interactions you had with our ads on third partyâ€™s websites or apps.Technical DataUsing the service involves the collection of data from and about the device(s) you use to access our service, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.

If you decline permission, features that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.Face Geometry DataYou may choose to participate in certain of our features, like Selfie Verification, that involve the collection of face geometry data, which may be considered biometric data in some jurisdictions. Learn more here about our verification feature and how we process your face geometry data.ID DataYou may provide us with a copy of your government-issued ID to help us check that youâ€™re who you say you are.4.
