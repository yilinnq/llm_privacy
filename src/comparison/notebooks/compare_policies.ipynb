      "| **Data Collection** | Extremely broad, encompassing everything from user-provided information (including sensitive data) to activity logs, device data (even when location services are off), information from partners (including third-party websites), and inferred data.  Collects data from account holders and non-account holders.  Explicitly mentions religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health data, and other potentially sensitive information. | Focuses on professional data. Collects information directly from users (name, contact, work history, skills, etc.), data from others' profiles, activity logs, and inferred data.  Collects data from partners and other sources, but emphasizes professional connections and employment information. |\n",
      "| **Data Sharing** | Shares data across Meta's products and with a vast range of third parties (advertisers, measurement vendors, service providers, researchers, integrated partners) often without explicit opt-out options for some categories.  Acknowledges sharing information for safety and security, but doesn't specify how this is balanced with user privacy.   | Primarily shares data with users' professional connections, employers, and recruiters. Shares data with third parties for advertising, but focuses on professional contexts. Less extensive data sharing with third parties compared to Meta. |\n",
      "| **User Rights** |  Offers tools for viewing, downloading, and deleting information, and managing ad preferences. References \"other privacy rights under applicable laws.\" | Offers tools for accessing, deleting, correcting, limiting data use, and exporting data.  Emphasizes user choices and settings.  Explicitly notes additional rights for residents of designated European countries. |\n",
      "| **Cookies** | Uses cookies and similar technologies extensively for personalization, advertising, and product improvement.  Provides links to their Cookies Policy. | Uses cookies for personalization, advertising, and site functionality.  Clearly describes how cookies are used and provides a Cookie Policy. |\n",
      "| **Third-party Data** | Collects a vast amount of data from third-party sources, including those involved in advertising, analytics, and product development. | Collects data from third parties in a professional context, often for networking or talent acquisition.  |\n",
      "| **Data Retention** | Retains data for as long as necessary for service provision, legal obligations, or preventing harm, sometimes for an extended period following account closure.  This is presented as a case-by-case basis but doesn't always give specific guidelines. | Retains data as long as the account is open, or as necessary for legal obligations.   Gives guidelines regarding deletion after account closure. |\n",
      "| **Security Measures** | Mentions security safeguards (e.g., HTTPS) and monitoring for vulnerabilities but doesn't provide specifics. |  Mentions security safeguards (e.g., HTTPS) and regular monitoring.  Encourages use of security features like two-factor authentication. |\n",

      "* **Scope of Data:** Facebook's data collection is significantly broader, encompassing more personal and potentially sensitive information, and includes more data inferred or collected from third parties.  LinkedIn focuses primarily on professional data.\n",
